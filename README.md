# Marvel Datasets and Visualizations

Playing with Marvel API data to d3 visualization(s).

Generally a playground of works in progress, but sharing regardless.

## Visualizations

### Film Universes Co-Occurrence

  A visualization to show that Deadpool isn't in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or Marvel film character co-occurrences (two characters showing up in the same film) clustered by their main series to distinguish the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Avengers), the Earth-10005 Universe (X-Men), and the Marvel TV Series on Netflix (The Defenders)

## Notes

_I've not shared the script used to pull data from Marvel's API - I'll leave that to you to do on your own. That said, to build these visualizations I did have to cache an extensive amount of data from Marvel Developer. That data will be updated regularly according to the Marvel Developer terms of use._
